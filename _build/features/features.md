# Features

This is a short demonstration textbook to show the general layout / style of textbooks built
with Jupyter and Jekyll.

To begin, click on one of the chapter sections in the sidebar to the left.
Alternatively, click on the "next" button below in order to read
further.

The first sections demonstrate some simple functionality of Jupyter Books,
while the final chapters contain a subset of content from the
[Foundations in Data Science](https://inferentialthinking.com) textbook.
