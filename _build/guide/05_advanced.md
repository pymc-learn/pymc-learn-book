This page contains more advanced and complete information about the
[`jupyter-book` repository](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book). See the sections below.

## Hide cells or cell outputs in the built site

Sometimes you want to use code to generate visualizations or prepare data,
but you don't want users to see it in your built book. To prevent code cells
from showing up in your built site, you can use the following two configuration
options in your `_config.yml` file.

**To remove entire code cells from your book**, use the following configuration:

```yaml
hide_cell_text : "YOUR TEXT"
```

Any code cell with the value of `hide_cell_text` (above it is `YOUR TEXT`)
will not show up in your built book.

**To remove only the code, but retain the outputs or a cell**, use the following
configuration:

```yaml
hide_code_text: "YOUR TEXT"
```

Any code cell with the value of `hide_code_text` (above it is `YOUR TEXT`)
will show the output (e.g. images, HTML, etc) but not the input code that
generated this output.

In both cases, the cells *will* remain in the notebooks themselves, they
simply won't show up in the site's HTML, so links that point to a JupyterHub/
Binder/etc will still work as expected.

## Enable Google Analytics

If you have a Google Account, you can use Google Analytics to collect some 
information on the traffic to your Jupyter Book. With this tool, you can find 
out how many people are using your site, where they come from and how they 
access it, wether they are using the Desktop or the mobile version etc. 

To add Google Analytics to your Jupyter Book, navigate to 
[Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/), create a new 
Google Analytics account and add the url of your Jupyter Book to a new 
*property*. Once you have set everything up, your Google Analytics property 
will have a so-called Tracking-ID, that typically starts with the letters UA. 
All that you need to do is to copy this ID and paste it into your 
configuration file:

```yaml
google_analytics:
  mytrackingcode: UA-XXXXXXXXX-X
```

## Retain custom YAML front-matter in your files

Jupyter book will check your files for YAML front-matter and will **append**
any newly-generated YAML to the built files for the page. This means you
can provide your own custom YAML to files (which may be useful if you'd like
to modify this site's HTML).

Be careful not to add YAML with the same key names as the auto-generated YAML, as
this will create duplicated keys in your page's front-matter.


## Deploying a JupyterHub

If you wish, you may deploy a JupyterHub alongside your textbook. This way, for pages that are built from
Jupyter Notebooks, students can click the "interact" links
at the top of each page and be taken to a live Jupyter Notebook running on your JupyterHub.

The easiest way to set up a JupyterHub is to follow [The Littlest JupyterHub guide](https://the-littlest-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
This is a straightforward deployment of JupyterHub on a single VM, and is suitable for
courses / workshops of less than 50-60 students.

Once you have your JupyterHub set up, you can use the [nbgitpuller](https://github.com/data-8/nbgitpuller)
package to send links to course material to your students, or use the interact links that Textbooks for Jupyter
automatically inserts into your course material.
